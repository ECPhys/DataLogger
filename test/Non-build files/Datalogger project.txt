Datalogger project
Steps taken so far:
1. Bought M5stickC Plus 2 for Â£18
    - Runs on ESP32 processor
    - Wifi and bluetooth
    - Mic, buzzer, screen, accelerometer, IR LED 200mAh battery, USBC connection, Grove port
2. Installed Visual Studio Code 
    - C++ extension for programming in C++
    - installed M5UNified library
    - Signed up to Github Education for a free Github Copilot extension
3. Intalled PlatformIO which is a way of connecting VSCode to the ESP32
4. Tried an example from randomNerdTutorials for BLE Sensors   
    Sensor sketch
        Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) libraries used
    HTML file opened in browser
    CSS file for styling the HTML
5. Temperature probe connected
    DS18b20 temperature probe using
        Onewire library
        Dallas Sensors library
6. Installed Git on the computer and synced this project with a github repository online

End Goals:
- Datalogger that can be projected for a class
- Prototype for a class set of dataloggers that can be used by older students with devices
Sensors:
    - Temperature x 5
    - Mass balance
    - Voltage and current
    - Time of flight sensor (distance)
    - Speed from ToF
    - Acceleration
    - Sound analysis using Microphone
Ideally this would be available as 
    - values
    - Graphs
    - exportable tables of data 

Medium Term jobs:
1. HTML code to produce Graphs
     HTML code to view different values

2. More sensors integrated

3. Menu system and overarching code logic

4. Integration with PhyPhox BLE

5. Low power
